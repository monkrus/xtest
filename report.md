Hi Xenia,

Yes, machine learning models can be used to accurately classify malware based on packet captures. There have been numerous research papers published on this topic, using different machine learning algorithms and techniques.

Some examples include:
1. "IoT Malicious Traffic Classification Using Machine Learning" (2019), which uses six different machine learning algorithms to identify IoT traffic.ses six different machine learning algorithms which are Naive Bayes [1], Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression 

2. "Deep Learning for Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis" (2021), which uses different deep learning models to classify network traffic.

3. "A Machine Learning Approach for Reconnaissance Detection to Improve Intrusion Detection System" (2022), which uses machine learning to detect reconnaissance attacks.

These studies demonstrate that machine learning models can be effectively used for malware classification based on packet captures. However, the accuracy of the classification depends on the quality of the features extracted from the packet captures and the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithm used.

"IoT Malicious Traffic Classification Using Machine Learning" (2019) uses six different machine learning algorithms which are Naive Bayes [1], Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression to identify IoT traffic.

"Deep Learning for Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis" (2021) uses different deep learning models such as autoencoders, stacked autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) to classify network traffic.

"A Machine Learning Approach for Reconnaissance Detection to Improve Intrusion Detection System" (2022) uses a hybrid intrusion detection model that is based on the enhanced genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (EGA-PSO) algorithm to detect reconnaissance attacks. The study does not seem to involve using multiple machine learning models or algorithms for the specific task of reconnaissance detection.

Regarding the second question, choosing the best machine learning algorithm for a specific task often requires experimenting with different models and evaluating their performance on the data. In this case, you could try training and evaluating several different machine learning models, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), among others. You can train each model on a subset of the data and evaluate its performance on a validation set or by using cross-validation techniques. Choose the model with the best performance based on its accuracy, precision and recall, or other performance metrics, applied to the test set. The most suitable model for your specific task may depend on the characteristics of your data, such as the number of features, the size of the data set, and the complexity of the problem. It is generally recommended to start with a simple model and gradually increase the complexity until the best performance is reached.

Since we are starting with a simple model, the best option would be to begin with using Decision Trees or Random Forests.

In terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, it's difficult to give a clear answer since it depends on the specific dataset and how the models are implemented. However, in general, Random Forests tend to perform better than Decision Trees due to their ability to reduce overfitting by using multiple decision trees and taking the average of their predictions.

That being said, it's important to try out different models and compare their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. One can implement cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's performance is measured effectively.
